And that way of thinking is to define every experience or idea relative to self, to personalize our actions, to create the culture of &quotI&quot. <br><br>For example, I&rsquo;ve made a few YouTube videos on the topic Bioengineering (which is my major in undergrad). I&rsquo;ve received many emails and comments asking what exactly is Bioengineering and what opportunities lie within this field. One can easily google the definition of Bioengineering, but I always ask my viewers to go beyond this and ask themselves: <br><br> What does Bioengineering mean to you? In school, we learn about the past innovations/inventions already made in Bioengineering. But what change are you going to bring to Bioengineering? How are you going to alter the definition of Bioengineering that you just googled?<br><br> A few months back, I challenged myself to make a video that explained computational chemistry (my undergrad research) in a fun and intuitive way. How can I make a subject as niche as computational chemistry relatable to the general public? How can I transform someone&rsquo;s thinking of &quotew computational chemistry&quot to &quotcomputational chemistry is just like my Philz iced coffee order&quot? <br><br> I answered these questions with the simple concept that everything becomes more malleable, more relatable with the introduction of &quotI&quot. Show the audience the connection between two ideas and let them architect the rest of their experience. <br><br> Let us think uniquely. <br><br>';

This showcase was special, not only because this was an opportunity for me to present my Kalman Kick project, but because underrepresented students in STEM from around the Bay Area were invited to watch. The goal was to encourage young students, who may have not had the proper exposure or resources, to pursue STEM. I had the opportunity to meet with them in groups, show them why I was passionate about science and engineering, and emphasize the importance of going after what we believe to be important. That day, it was awesome to witness impact being made in real-time. Since then, the principle of outreach and getting others excited about STEM has been embedded in me, even making its way into my Youtube videos.<br><br> The summer before my freshman year at college, I started out writing on Medium as an independent writer and now write for 3 of Medium&rsquo;s top 5 publications. Medium writing has been pivotal for me because it introduced me to the scalability of digital content. In my English class, the professor and, maybe one peer, would be the only eyes to read my writing. But on Medium, the instant I hit publish, I could impact anyone in the world.<br><br><br>";
